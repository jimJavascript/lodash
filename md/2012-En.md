American military adventurism, but that’s not how it used to be. To the men and women who 1

farm kid torn away from his home,the guy who 3 all the burdens of battle,who slept in cold

character,or a 12 of American personalities, in the 1945 movie The Story of G.I. Joe, based on

the last days of war correspondent Ernie Pyle. Some of the soldiers Pyle 13 portrayed

themselves in the film. Pyle was famous for covering the 14 side of the war, writing about the

   Homework  has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in

recent years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los

Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on this educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified

has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced

courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student’s academic grade.

   This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes

might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly,

no homework should be assigned that students cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the

district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of

complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be

lowered for poor children.

   District administrators say that homework will still be a part of schooling: teachers are

allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10%

of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see very little difference on their

report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but

what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite

possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best

for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.

   At the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. If

the district finds homework to be unimportant to its students’ academic achievement, it should

move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely,

if homework matters, it should account for a significant portion of the grade. Meanwhile, this

policy does nothing to ensure that the homework students receive is meaningful or appropriate to

their age and the subject, or that teachers are not assigning more than they are willing to review

and correct.

   The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is responsible for

setting educational policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for

L. A. Unified to do homework right.

21. It is implied in paragraph 1 that nowadays homework_____.

   [A] is receiving more criticism      [B]is no longer an educational ritual

   [C]is not required for advanced courses [D]is gaining more preferences

   [D]have voiced their complaints about homework

23. According to Paragraph 3,one problem with the policy is that it may_____.

   [A]discourage students from doing homework

   [B]result in students' indifference to their report cards

   [C]undermine the authority of state tests

   [D]restrict teachers' power in education

24. As mentioned in Paragraph 4, a key question unanswered about homework is whether_____.

   Pretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is

pervasive in our young girls’ lives. It is not that pink is intrinsically bad, but it is such a tiny slice

of the rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly

fuses girls’ identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds,

between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, I despaired at

the singular lack of imagination about girls’ lives and interests.

   Girls’ attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but

according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies, it is not. Children were not

colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domestic washing machines all

babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil

them. What’s more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses.

When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a

pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin

Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolized femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when

amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children’s marketing strategy, that pink

4   

fully came into its own, when it began to seem inherently attractive to girls, part of what defined

them as female, at least for the first few critical years.

   I had not realized how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural

to kids, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I

assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children’s

behaviour: wrong. Turns out, according to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it

was popularized as a marketing trick by clothing manufacturers in the 1930s.

   Trade publications counselled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should

create a “third stepping stone” between infant wear and older kids’ clothes. It was only after

“toddler”became a common shoppers’ term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental

stage. Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost

profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences —or

invent them where they did not previously exist.

26. By saying "it is…the rainbow"(Line 2, Para. 1),the author means pink______.

   [A]should not be the sole representation of girlhood

   [B]should not be associated with girls' innocence

   [C]cannot explain girls' lack of imagination

   [D]cannot influence girls' lives and interests

27. According to Paragraph 2, which of the following is true of colours？

   [A]Colours are encoded in girls' DNA.

   [B]Blue used to be regarded as the colour for girls.

   [C]Pink used to be a neutral colour in symbolizing genders.

   [D]White is preferred by babies.

28. The author suggests that our perception of children's psychological development was much

influenced by_____.

   [A]the marketing of products for children

   [B]the observation of children's nature

   [C]researches into children's behavior

   [D]studies of childhood consumption

29. We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised to_____.

   [A]focus on infant wear and older kids' clothes

   [B]attach equal importance to different genders

   [C]classify consumers into smaller groups

   [D]create some common shoppers' terms

30. It can be concluded that girls' attraction to pink seems to be______.

   [A] clearly explained by their inborn tendency

   [B]fully understood by clothing manufacturers

   [C] mainly imposed by profit-driven businessmen

   [D]well interpreted by psychological experts

   In 2010, a federal judge shook America's biotech industry to its core. Companies had won

patents for isolated DNA for decades—by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. But in

March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The

Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a

“preliminary step” in a longer battle.

   On July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the

prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help

forecast a woman's risk of breast cancer. The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah,said

the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.

   But as companies continue their attempts at personalized medicine, the courts will remain

rather busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments

against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents

suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests

such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for

patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad

case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature…than are cotton fibres

that have been separated from cotton seeds.”

   Despite the appeal court's decision, big questions remain unanswered. For example, it is

unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within

it. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.

   As the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. Companies

are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules-most are already patented or in

the public domain. Firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might

6   

be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug’s efficacy. Companies are eager to win

patents for ‘connecting the dots’, explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.

   Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic,

which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term.The BIO recently held a convention which

included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was

packed.

31. It can be learned from paragraph I that the biotech companies would like________.

   [A] their executives to be active

   [B] judges to rule out gene patenting

   [C] genes to be patentable

   [D] the BIO to issue a warning

32. Those who are against gene patents believe that________.

   [A] genetic tests are not reliable

   [B] only man-made products are patentable

   [C] patents on genes depend much on innovation

   [D] courts should restrict access to genetic tests

33. According to Hans Sauer,companies are eager to win patents for________.

   [A] establishing disease correlations

   [B] discovering gene interactions

   [C] drawing pictures of genes

   [D] identifying human DNA

34. By saying “each meeting was packed”(line4,para6)the author means that ________.

   [A] the supreme court was authoritative

   [B] the BIO was a powerful organization

   [C] gene patenting was a great concern

   [D] lawyers were keen to attend conventions

35. Generally speaking,the author’s attitude toward gene patenting is________.

   [A] critical   [B] supportive       [C] scornful      [D] objective

   The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning.

Before it ends, it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults.

And ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics,our culture, and the character of our society for

years.

   No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster.

Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they

had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles

of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off. At the very least,

it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a

necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.

   But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral

Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both

inside and outside the U. S. ,lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always

left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the

advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict

between races and classes.

   Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one. Indeed,

this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross

them--- especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia

University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed:

those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would

have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.

   In the internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden

within American society. More difficult, in the moment, is discerning precisely how these lean

times are affecting society’s character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant

entering this recession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social

conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard

times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly will reshape it, and all the more so the

longer they extend.

36. By saying “to find silver linings”（Line 1,Para. 2）the author suggests that the jobless try

to_____.

   [A]seek subsidies from the government

   [B]explore reasons for the unemployment

8   

   [C]make profits from the troubled economy

   [D]look on the bright side of the recession

37. According to Paragraph 2, the recession has made people_____.

   [A]realize the national dream

   [B]struggle against each other

   [C]challenge their lifestyle

   [D]reconsider their lifestyle

38. Benjamin Friedman believes that economic recessions may_____.

   [A]impose a heavier burden on immigrants

   [B]bring out more evils of human nature

   [C] promote the advance of rights and freedoms

   [D]ease conflicts between races and classes

39. The research of Till Von Wachther suggests that in recession graduates from elite universities

tend to _____.

   [A]lag behind the others due to decreased opportunities

   [B]catch up quickly with experienced employees

   [C]see their life chances as dimmed as the others’

   [D]recover more quickly than the others

   “Universal history, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the

History of the Great Men who have worked here,” wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Well,

not any more it is not.

   Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no

more than a passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach

the past: less concerned with learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain.

Today, we want empathy, not inspiration.

   

   From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the

exemplary lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris

Illustribus―On Famous Men, highlighting the virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. Petrarch

celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical

tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, he championed cunning,

ruthlessness, and boldness, rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.

   Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading

painters and authors of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist's personal experience rather

than public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue

of the worthy lives of engineers, industrialists and explores. "The valuable examples which they

furnish of the power of self-help, of patient purpose, resolute working and steadfast integrity,

issuing in the formulation of truly noble and many character, exhibit,"wrote Smiles. "What it is in

the power of each to accomplish for himself."His biographies of James Walt, Richard Arkwright

and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.

   This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly

heroic lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures

represented lives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere

mortals.

   Not everyone was convinced by such bombast. “The history of all hitherto existing society is

the history of class struggles,” wrote Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto. For them,

history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles:“It is man, real, living man

who does all that.” And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle. As

such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in

which each epoch stood. For:“Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they

please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances

directly found, given and transmitted from the past. ”

   This was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas

Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from

below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole new realms of understanding― from

10  

gender to race to cultural studies - were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost

societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs.

                  [A] emphasized the virtue of classical heroes.

 41. Petrarch         [B] highlighted the public glory of the leading artists.

 42. Niccolo Machiavellli [C] focused on epochal figures whose lives were hard to imitate.

   When people in developing countries worry about migration,they are usually concerned at

the prospect of their best and brightest departure to Silicon Valley or to hospitals and universities

in the developed world. These are the kind of workers that countries like Britain,Canada and

Australia try to attract by using immigration rules that privilege college graduates.

   Lots of studies have found that well-educated people from developing countries are

particularly likely to emigrate. A big survey of Indian households in 2004 found that nearly 40%

of emigrants had more than a high-school education,compared with around 3. 3% of all Indians

over the age of 25. This "brain drain"has long bothered policymakers in poor countries. They fear

that it hurts their economies,depriving them of much-needed skilled workers who could have

taught at their universities,worked in their hospitals and come up with clever new products for

their factories to make.
