   People have speculated for centuries about a future without work. Today is no different with

academics, writers, and activists once again 1 that technology be replacing human workers.

Some imagine that the coming work-free world will be defined by 2 . A few wealthy people

will own all the capital, and the masses will struggle in an impoverished wasteland.

   A different and not mutually exclusive 3 holds that the future will be a wasteland of a

different sort, one 4 by purposelessness: Without jobs to give their lives 5 , people will

simply become lazy and depressed. 6 , today’s unemployed don’t seem to be have a great time.

One Gallup poll found that 20 percent of Americans who have been unemployed for at least a year

report having depression, double the rate for 7 Americans. Also, some research suggests that

the   8   for rising rates of mortality, mental-health problems, and addicting 9

poorly-educated middle-aged people is shortage of well-paid jobs. Perhaps this is why many 10

the agonizing dullness of a jobless future.

   But it doesn’t 11 follow from findings like these that a world without work would be

filled with unease. Such visions are based on the 12 of being unemployed in a society built on

the concept of employment. In the 13 of work, a society designed with other ends in mind could

14   strikingly different circumstances for the future of labor and leisure. Today, the 15 of

work may be a bit overblown. “Many jobs are boring, degrading, unhealthy, and a waste of human

potential,” says John Danaher, a lecturer at the National University of Ireland in Galway.

   These days, because leisure time is relatively 16 for most workers, people use their free

time to counterbalance the intellectual and emotional 17 of their jobs. “When I come home

from a hard day’s work, I often feel 18 ,” Danaher says, adding, “In a world in which I don’t

have to work, I might feel rather different”—perhaps different enough to throw himself 19 a

hobby or a passion project with the intensity usually reserved for 20 matters.

   Every Saturday morning, at 9 am, more than 50,000 runners set off to run 5km around their

local park.The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the

UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four

years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley’s world record 13 minutes 48

seconds up to an hour.

   Parkrun is succeeding where London’s Olympic “legacy” is failing. Ten years ago, on

Monday, it was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning

documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers

away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It

has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the

run—up to 2012—but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now

falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two

hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official

retrospections continue as to why London 2012 failed to “inspire a generation.” The success of

Parkrun offers answers.

   Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes

anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is

about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing

sports and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over

taking part was intimidating for newcomers.

   Indeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such

a fundamentally “grassroots”, concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for

government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods—making sure there

is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the

provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling

green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education.

Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions

for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.

   With so much focus on children use of screens, it is easy for parents to forget about their own

4   

screen use. “Tech is designed to really suck you in ,”says Jenny Redesky in her study of digital

play, “and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to

disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine.”

   Redesky has studied the use of mobile phone and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child

pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who used devices during the exercise stared

20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interaction with their children. During a

separate observation she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would

be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.

   Infants are wired to look at parents faces try to understand their world, and if those faces are

blank and unresponsive-as they often are when absorbed in a device-it can be extremely

disconcerting for the children. Radesky cites the “still face experiment” devised by developmental

psychologist. Ed Tronick in the 1970s. in it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a

normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback:

the child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother’s attention. “Parents

don’t have to be exquisitely present at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need

to be responsive and sensitive to be a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional

need,” says Radesky.

   On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kid’s use of screens

are born out of an “oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting”

with their children: “It is based on a somewhat fantasized very white, very upper-middle-class

ideology that says if you’re failing to expose your child to 3000words you are neglecting them”

Tronick believes that just because a child isn’t learning from the screen doesn’t mean there’s no

value to it—particularly if gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a

break from their child.Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend

or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets them to be more

available to their child the rest of the time.

26. According to Jenny Radesky, digital products are designed to ______.

[A] simplify routine matters

[B] absorb user attention

[C] better interpersonal relations

[D] increase work efficiency

[B] teach their kids at least 30,000 words a year

   Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with

increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely

overlook the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in

the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn’t it? And after going to school for 12 years, it

6   

doesn’t feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn’t academic.

   But while this may be true, it’s not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There’s

always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated “race to the

finish line,” whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But

despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits—in

fact, it probably enhances it.

   Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are

generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than

pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new

responsibilities and environmental changes—all things that first-year students often struggle with

the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and

being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities

rather than acclimation blunders.

   If you’re not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then

consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for

Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least

once. This isn’t surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves

students with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications,

but switching to another after taking college classes. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but

depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game.

At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to

the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can

help prevent stress and save money later on.

31. One of the reasons for high-school graduates not taking a gap year is that_______.

[A] they think it academically misleading

[B] they have a lot of fun to expect in college

[C] it feels strange to do differently from others

[D] it seems worthless to take off-campus courses

32. Studies from the US and Australia imply that taking a gap year helps_______.

[A] keep students from being unrealistic

[B] lower risks in choosing careers

[C] ease freshmen’s financial burdens

[D] relieve freshmen of pressures

33. The word “acclimation” (Line 6, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to_______.

[A] adaptation

[B] application

[C] motivation

[D] competition

34. A gap year may save money for students by helping them_______.

[A] avoid academic failures

[B] establish long-term goals

[C] switch to another college

[D] decide on the right major

35. The most suitable title for this text would be_______.

[A] In Favor of the Gap Year

[B] The ABCs of the Gap Year

[C] The Gap Year Comes Back

[D] The Gap Year: A Dilemma

   Though often viewed as a problem for western states, the growing frequency of wildfires is a

national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars, says Professor Max Moritz, a

specialist in fire ecology and management.

   In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion

annual budget fighting fires—nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago.

In effect, fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency’s other work—such as forest

8   

conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep—that

affect the lives of all Americans.

   Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into

construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes

that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?

   “It’s already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country,” he

says.” We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, “Wait a minute, is this OK?” “Do we want

instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?”

   Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire,

researchers say.

   For one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade,

the focus has been on climate change—how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is

leading to conditions that worsen fires.

   While climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn’t come at the expense of the rest of

the equation.

   “The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both

ways,” he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to “an overly simplified view of what the

solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very

limited.”

   At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled

and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But

acknowledging fire’s inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws,

policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.

   “We’ve disconnected ourselves from living with fire,” Balch says. “It is really important to

understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today.”

36. More frequent wildfires have become a national concern because in 2015 they_______.

[A] exhausted unprecedented management efforts

[B] consumed a record-high percentage of budget

   

[C] severely damaged the ecology of western states

[D] caused a huge rise of infrastructure expenditure

37. Moritz calls for the use of “a magnifying glass” to_______.

[A] raise more funds for fire-prone areas

[B] avoid the redirection of federal money

[C] find wildfire-free parts of the landscape

[D] guarantee safer spending of public funds

38. While admitting that climate is a key element, Moritz notes that_______.

[A] public debates have not settled yet

[B] fire-fighting conditions are improving

[C] other factors should not be overlooked

[D] a shift in the view of fire has taken place

39. The overly simplified view Moritz mentions is a result of failing to_______.

[A] discover the fundamental makeup of nature

[B] explore the mechanism of the human systems

[C] maximize the role of landscape in human life

[D] understand the interrelations of man and nature

40. Professor Balch points out that fire is something man should_______.

   The decline in American manufacturing is a common refrain, particularly from Donald

Trump. “We don’t make anything anymore,” he told Fox News, while defending his own

made-in-Mexico clothing line.

   Without question, manufacturing has taken a significant hit during recent decades, and further

trade deals raise questions about whether new shocks could hit manufacturing.

   But there is also a different way to look at the data.

   Across the country, factory owners are now grappling with a new challenge: instead of

having too many workers, they may end up with too few. Despite trade competition and

outsourcing, American manufacturing still needs to replace tens of thousands of retiring boomers

every years. Millennials may not be that interested in taking their place, other industries are

recruiting them with similar or better pay.

   For factory owners, it all adds up to stiff competition for workers—and upward pressure on

wages. “They’re harder to find and they have job offers,” says Jay Dunwell, president of

Wolverine Coil Spring, a family-owned firm, “They may be coming [into the workforce], but

they’ve been plucked by other industries that are also doing as well as manufacturing,” Mr.

Dunwell has begun bringing high school juniors to the factory so they can get exposed to its

culture.

   At RoMan Manufacturing, a maker of electrical transformers and welding equipment that his

father cofounded in 1980, Robert Roth keeps a close eye on the age of his nearly 200 workers.Five

are retiring this year. Mr. Roth has three community-college students enrolled in a work-placement

program, with a starting wage of $13 an hour that rises to $17 after two years.

   At a worktable inside the transformer plant, young Jason Stenquist looks flustered by the

copper coils he’s trying to assemble and the arrival of two visitors. It’s his first week on the job.

Asked about his choice of career, he says at high school he considered medical school before

switching to electrical engineering. “I love working with tools. I love creating.” he says.

   But to win over these young workers, manufacturers have to clear another major hurdle:

parents, who lived through the worst US economic downturn since the Great Depression, telling

them to avoid the factory. Millennials “remember their father and mother both were laid off. They

blame it on the manufacturing recession,” says Birgit Klohs, chief executive of The Right Place, a

1

business development agency for western Michigan.

   These concerns aren’t misplaced: Employment in manufacturing has fallen from 17 million

in 1970 to 12 million in 2013. When the recovery began, worker shortages first appeared in the

high-skilled trades. Now shortages are appearing at the mid-skill levels.

   “The gap is between the jobs that take to skills and those that require a lot of skill,” says Rob

Spohr, a business professor at Montcalm Community College. “There’re enough people to fill the

jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don’t need to have much skill. It’s that gap in

between, and that’s where the problem is. ”

   Julie Parks of Grand Rapids Community points to another key to luring Millennials into

manufacturing: a work/life balance. While their parents were content to work long hours, young

people value flexibility. “Overtime is not attractive to this generation. They really want to live

their lives,” she says.

                  [A]says that he switched to electrical engineering because he loves

                  working tools.

41. Jay Dunwell       [B]points out that there are enough people to fill the jobs that don’t need

                  much sills

42. Jason Stenquist    [C]points out that US doesn’t manufacture anything anymore.

43. Birgit Klohs      [D]believes that it is important to keep a close eye on the age of his

                  workers.

44. Rob Spohr         [E]says that for factory owners, workers are harder to find because of

                  stiff competition.

45. Julie Parks       [F]points out that a work/life balance can attract young people into

                  manufacturing.

                  [G]says that the manufacturing recession is to blame for the lay- off of

                  the young people’s parents.

   My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing.

Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking

that I would move on to a fashion design course. However, during that course I realized I was not

good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided

that it was not the right path for me. Before applying for university, I told everyone that I would

study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favorite activities. But, to be honest,

I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream ---I knew that no one

could imagine me in the fashion industry at all! So I decided to look for some fashion-related

courses that included writing. This is when I noticed the course “Fashion Media & Promotion”.
