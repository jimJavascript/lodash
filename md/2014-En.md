    Thinner isn’t always better. A number of studies have 1 that normal-weight people are in
fact at higher risk of some diseases compared to those who are overweight. And there are health
conditions for which being overweight is actually 2 . For example, heavier women are less
likely to develop calcium deficiency than thin women. 3 among the elderly, being somewhat
overweight is often an      4    of good health.
    Of even greater 5 is the fact that obesity turns out to be very difficult to define. It is often
defined 6  body mass index, or BMI. BMI 7 body mass divided by the square of height. An
adult with a BMI of 18 to 25 is often considered to be normal weight. Between 25 and 30 is
overweight. And over 30 is considered obese. Obesity, 8 , can be divided into moderately
obese, severely obese, and very severely obese.
    While such numerical standards seem 9 , they are not. Obesity is probably less a matter of
weight than body fat. Some people with a high BMI are in fact extremely fit, 10 others with a
low BMI may be in poor 11 . For example, many collegiate and professional football players
12  as obese, though their percentage body fat is low. Conversely, someone with a small frame
may have high body fat but a 13 BMI.
    Today we have a(an) 14 to label obesity as a disgrace.The overweight are sometimes 15
in the media with their faces covered. Stereotypes 16 with obesity include laziness,lack of will
power,and lower prospects for success.Teachers,employers,and health professionals have been
shown to harbor biases against the obese. 17 very young children tend to look down on the
overweight, and teasing about body build has long been a problem in schools.
    Negative attitudes toward obesity, 18 in health concerns, have stimulated a number of
anti-obesity 19 . My own hospital system has banned sugary drinks from its facilities. Many
employers have instituted weight loss and fitness initiatives. Michelle Obama launched a
high-visibility campaign 20 childhood obesity, even claiming that it represents our greatest
national security threat.

    What would you do  with $590m? This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an
84-year-old widow who recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect
the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found fortune will yield
lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dunn and
Michael Norton.
    These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding
ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of
fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly
quickly what was once exciting and new becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend
money on experiences, say Ms Dunn and Mr Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even
going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with time-as stories or
memories-particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.
    This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the
most “happiness bang for your buck.” It seems most people would be better off if they could
shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching
television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is
hardly jollier for it).Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing
things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is
apparently the reason McDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib — a marketing
trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.
    Readers of “Happy Money” are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not
hunger.Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally
    3
happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others
can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity enhances the pleasure of
most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors’ policy ideas, which range
from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers. But most
people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent.
21. According to Dunn and Norton,which of the following is the most rewarding purchase?
    [A]A big house     [B]A special tour [C]A stylish car  [D]A rich meal

    An article in Scientific America has pointed out that empirical research says that, actually,you
think you’re more beautiful than you are. We have a deep-seated need to feel good about
ourselves and we naturally employ a number of self-enhancing strategies to achieve this. Social
psychologists have amassed oceans of research into what they call the “above average effect”, or
4   
“illusory superiority”, and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselves as above average in
leadership, 93% in driving and85% at getting on well with others—all obviously statistical
impossibilities.
    We  rose-tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. We become
defensive when criticized, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem.We
stalk around thinking we’re hot stuff.
    Psychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying into
self-enhancement and attractiveness. Rather than have people simply rate their beauty compare
with others, he asked them to identify an original photograph of themselves from a lineup
including versions that had been altered to appear more and less attractive. Visual recognition,
reads the study, is “an automatic psychological process occurring rapidly and intuitively with little
or no apparent conscious deliberation”. If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image---
which must did--- they genuinely believed it was really how they looked.
    Epley found no significant gender difference in responses. Nor was there any evidence that
those who self-enhance the most (that is, the participants who thought the most positively
doctored picture were real) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In fact, those who
thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with
those who showed other makers for having higher self-esteem. “I don’t think the findings that we
have are any evidence of personal delusion”, says Epley. “It’s a reflection simply of people
generally thinking well of themselves’. If you are depressed, you won’t be self-enhancing.
    Knowing the results of Epley’s study, it makes sense that why people hate photographs of
themselves so viscerally — on one level, they don’t even recognise the person in the picture as
themselves. Facebook, therefore,is a self-enhancer’s paradise,where people can share only the
most flattering photos, the cream of their wit, style, beauty, intellect and lifestyle. “It’s not that
people’s profiles are dishonest,says Catalina Toma of Wiscon—Madison university ,”but they
portray an idealized version of themselves.
26. According to the first paragraph, social psychologists have found that ______.
    [A] our self-ratings are unrealistically high [B] illusory superiority is baseless effect
    [C] our need for leadership is unnatural [D]self-enhancing strategies are ineffective
27. Visual recognition is believed to be people’s ______.
    [A] rapid watching                     [B] conscious choice
    [C] intuitive response                 [D] automatic self-defence
28. Epley found that people with higher self-esteem tended to ______.
    [A] underestimate their insecurities   [B] believe in their attractiveness
    [C] cover up their depressions         [D] oversimplify their illusions
29.The word “viscerally”(Line 2,para.5) is closest in meaning to ______.
    [A]instinctively   [B]occasionally     [C]particularly    [D]aggressively
30. It can be inferred that Facebook is self-enhancer’s paradise because people can ______.
    [A]present their dishonest profiles    [B]define their traditional life styles
    [C]share their intellectual pursuits   [D]withhold their unflattering sides

    The concept of man versus machine is at least as old as the industrial revolution, but this
phenomenon tends to be most acutely felt during economic downturns and fragile recoveries. And
yet, it would be a mistake to think we are right now simply experiencing the painful side of a
boom  and bust cycle. Certain jobs have gone away for good, outmoded by machines. Since
technology has such an insatiable appetite for eating up human jobs, this phenomenon will
continue to restructure our economy in ways we can't immediately foresee.
    When there is exponential improvement in the price and performance of technology, jobs that
were once thought to be immune from automation suddenly become threatened. This argument
has attracted a lot of attention, via the success of the book Race Against the Machine, by Erik
Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who both hail from MIT's Center for Digital Business.
    This is a powerful argument, and a scary one. And yet, John Hagel, author of The Power of
Pull and other books, says Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss the reason why these jobs are so
vulnerable to technology in the first place.
    Hagel says we have designed jobs in the U.S. that tend to be “tightly scripted” and “highly
standardized”ones that leave no room for “individual initiative or creativity.” In short, these are
6   
the types of jobs that machines can perform much better at than human beings. That is how we
have put a giant target sign on the backs of American workers, Hagel says.
    It's time to reinvent the formula for how work is conducted, since we are still relying on a
very 20th century notion of work, Hagel says. In our rapidly changing economy, we more than
ever need people in the workplace who can take initiative and exercise their imagination “to
respond to unexpected events.” That's not something machines are good at. They are designed to
perform very predictable activities.
    As Hagel notes, Brynjolfsson and McAfee indeed touched on this point in their book. We
need to reframe race against the machine as race with the machine. In other words, we need to
look at the ways in which machines can augment human labor rather than replace it. So then the
problem is not really about technology, but rather, “how do we innovate our institutions and our
work practices?”
 31. According to the first paragraph, economic downturns would _____.
    [A] ease the competition of man vs. Machine
    [B] highlight machines’ threat to human jobs
    [C] provoke a painful technological revolution
    [D] outmode our current economic structure
32. The authors of Race Against the Machine argue that_____.
    [A] technology is diminishing man’s job opportunities
    [B] automation is accelerating technological development
    [C] certain jobs will remain intact after automation
    [D] man will finally win the race against machine
33. Hagel argues that jobs in the U.S. are often_____.
    [A] performed by innovative minds          [B] scripted with an individual style
    [C] standardized without a clear target    [D] designed against human creativity
34. According to the last paragraph, Brynjolfsson and McAfee discussed_____.
    [A] the predictability of machine behavior in practice
    [B] the formula for how work is conducted efficiently
    [C] the ways machines replace human labor in modern times
    [D] the necessity of human involvement in the workplace
35. Which of the following could be the most appropriate title for the text?
    [A] How to Innovate Our Work Practices
    [B] Machines Will Replace Human Labor
    [C] Can We Win the Race Against Machines
    [D] Economic Downturns Stimulate Innovations

    When  the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is
usually on roads, railways, broadband and energy. Housing is seldom mentioned.
    Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been
good at communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there
is the scale of the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among
multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere.
But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged.
    Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase all the time
and we are simply not building enough new homes.
    The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify
this. It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent
housing need.
    There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don
Foster, has hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more
flexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing
stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years if
the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.
    Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which
would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments
from revenues.
8   
    But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the
short term, we must face up to the fact that the existing £4.5bn programme of grants to fund new
affordable housing, set to expire in 2015, is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour
party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition’s spending plans if
returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to era
of large-scale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.
    While the government’s commitment to long- term funding may have changed, the very
pressing need for more affordable housing is real and is not going away.
36. The author believes that the housing sector_______.
    [A] has attracted much attention       [B] involves certain political factors
    [C] shoulders too much responsibility  [D] has lost its real value in economy
37. It can be learned that affordable housing has_______.
    [A] increased its home supply          [B] offered spending opportunities
    [C] suffered government biases         [D] disappointed the government
38. According to Paragraph 5, George Osborne may_______.
    [A] allow greater government debt for housing
    [B] stop local authorities from building homes
    [C] prepare to reduce housing stock debt
    [D] release a lifted GDP growth forecast
39. It can be inferred that a stable rental environment would_______.
    [A]lower the costs of registered providers
    [B]lessen the impact of government interference
    [C]contribute to funding new developments
    [D]relieve the ministers of responsibilities
40. The author believes that after 2015, the government may______.
    [A]implement more policies to support housing
    [B]review the need for large-scale public grants
    [C]renew the affordable housing grants programme
    
    [D]stop generous funding to the housing sector

    Emerging in the late Sixties and reaching a peak in the Seventies, Land Art was one of a
range of new forms, including Body Art, Performance Art, Action Art and Installation Art, which
pushed art beyond the traditional confines of the studio and gallery. Rather than portraying
landscape, land artists used the physical substance of the land itself as their medium.
    The message of this survey of British land art—the most comprehensive to date—is that the
British variant, typified by Long’s piece, was not only more domestically scaled, but a lot quirkier
than its American counterpart. Indeed, while you might assume that an exhibition of Land Art
would consist only of records of works rather than the works themselves, Long’s photograph of
his work is the work. Since his “action” is in the past the photograph is its sole embodiment.
    That might seem rather an obscure point, but it sets the tone for an exhibition that contains
a lot of black-and-white photographs and relatively few natural objects.
    Long is Britain’s best-known Land Artist and his Stone Circle, a perfect ring of purplish
rocks from Portishead beach laid out on the gallery floor, represents the elegant, rarefied side of
the form. The Boyle Family, on the other hand, stand for its dirty, urban aspect. Comprising artists
Mark Boyle and Joan Hills and their children, they recreated random sections of the British
landscape on gallery walls. Their Olaf Street Study, a square of brick-strewn waste ground, is one
of the few works here to embrace the mundanity that characterizes most of our experience of the
landscape most of the time.
    Parks feature, particularly in the earlier works, such as John Hilliard’s very funny Across the
Park, in which a long-haired stroller is variously smiled at a pretty girl and unwittingly assaulted
in a sequence of images that turn out to be different parts of the same photograph.
10  
    Generally however British land artists preferred to get away from towns, gravitating towards
landscapes that are traditionally considered beautiful such as the Lake District or the Wiltshire
Downs. While it probably wasn’t apparent at the time, much of this work is permeated by a spirit
of romantic escapism that the likes of Wordsworth would have readily understood. Derek
Jarman’s yellow-tinted film Towards Avebury, a collection of long, mostly still shots of the
Wiltshire landscape, evokes a tradition of English landscape painting stretching from Samuel
Palmer to Paul Nash.
    In the case of Hamish Fulton, you can’t help feeling that the Scottish artist has simply found
a way of making his love of walking pay. A typical work, such as Seven Days, consists of a single
beautiful black-and-white photograph taken on an epic walk, with the mileage and number of days
taken listed beneath. British Land Art as shown in this well selected, but relatively modestly
scaled exhibition wasn’t about imposing on the landscape, more a kind of landscape-orientated
light conceptual art created passing through. It had its origins in the great outdoors, but the results
were as gallery-bound as the paintings of Turner and Constable.

    Most people would define optimism as endlessly happy, with a glass that’s perpetually half
full. But that’s exactly the kind of false cheerfulness that positive psychologists wouldn’t
recommend. “Healthy optimists means being in touch with reality, ” says Tal Ben-Shahar, a
Harvard professor. According to Ben- Shalar, realistic optimists are those who make the best of
things that happen, but not those who believe everything happens for the best.
    Ben-Shalar uses three optimistic exercises. When he feels down — say, after giving a bad
lecture—he grants himself permission to be human. He reminds himself that not every lecture can
be a Nobel winner; some will be less effective than others. Next is reconstruction. He analyzes the
weak lecture, learning lessons for the future about what works and what doesn’t. Finally, there is
perspective, which involves acknowledging that in the grand scheme of life, one lecture really
doesn’t matter.
